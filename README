your neighborhood, please don't be cross when you take out someone's

.... Once upon a time we did stripe into Gnucash.  Now we're doing
quickbooks.  I'm trying to bludgeon some code in the orbit of the
OAUTH quickbooks world, into shape such that it can do a similar
function for us.

All of the stripe-to-quickbooks things I've played with so far are
just plain in the way.

Sush.io in particular can go die in a fire.  "Sales receipts" ?  Yeah,
we can do double entry, but ... why?... BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT ACCOUNTING
IS ABOUT?

Anyway.  I figured I owed you a readme. Here 'tis.
